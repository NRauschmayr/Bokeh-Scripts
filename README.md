# Bokeh-Scripts
 Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library. This repo provides some scripts that I used to visualize millions of 
 allocation statistics generated by FOM-tools (link to FOM-tools https://gitlab.cern.ch/fom/FOM-tools/tree/master/).
 This script shall just be an example for how powerful Bokeh is in order to explore interactively such datasets 
 (the repo just contains a very small example dataset). This Bokeh scripts plots lifetime of allocations. 
 Allocation statistics were generated by FOM tools and the corresponding lifetime was computed in a postprocessing step.
 Each point in the Bokeh plot presents an allocation and its lifetime and Bokeh's tooltip shows the corresponding stacktrace
 which has caused the allocation.
 Bokeh has been extremelly useful in order to find many interesting lifetime patterns in the vast of amount of allocation data.
 
 In order to run this script: 
 install bokeh and then execute "bokeh serve plot1.py", then open the URL http://localhost:5006/plot1
