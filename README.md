# Bokeh-Scripts
 Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library. This repo provides some scripts that I used to visualize millions of 
 allocation statistics generated by FOM-tools (link to FOM-tools https://github.com/FOM-Tools/FOM-Tools).
 This script shall just be an example for how powerful Bokeh is in order to explore interactively such datasets 
 (the repo just contains a very small example dataset). 
 Allocation statistics were generated by FOM tools and the corresponding lifetime was computed in a postprocessing step.
 Each point in the Bokeh plot presents an allocaed object and how long it lived. X-position indicates when the object was created,  y-position indicates the lifetime. The script uses Bokeh's tooltip to interactively show the corresponding stacktrace for each allocation. Following plot shows a screenshot:

 Bokeh has been extremelly useful in order to find many interesting object lifetime patterns in the vast of amount of allocation data.
 
 In order to run this script: 
 install bokeh and then execute "bokeh serve plot1.py", then open the URL http://localhost:5006/plot1
